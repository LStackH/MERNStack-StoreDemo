# How to run locally:
To run this project in full, you need to run both the backend and the frontend. 
To start the backend server, you can navigate into the backend folder and run 
```
npm start
```
To start the frontend, open another terminal, so that you don't close the backend process, and navigate into the frontend folder and run 
```
npm run dev
```

Now both the backend and frontend are running. 

Going into your browser and opening the link provided in the terminal, after starting the frontend
OR
Manually typing into your browser localhost:5000, assuming the port hasn't changed.
